This tool (is currently a mess and) provides autocompletion for Fitch-style first-order natural deduction, in a language without function symbols. 

Specifically, given a (structured) array of formulas, it finds justifications for these formulas, if there are any.

Surprisingly, I couldn't find any such existing tool. I will probably make this nicer in the future.
