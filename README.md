This tool provides autocompletion **of justifications** for Fitch- and (output-only) Gentzen-style first-order natural deduction, in a language without function symbols. 

Specifically, given a (structured) array of formulas, it finds justifications for these formulas, if there are any. 

Rendered deductions are printed as HTML and LaTeX, using either Fitch- or Gentzen-style. 

Please see help for more information.
