This tool provides autocompletion **of justifications** for Fitch-style first-order natural deduction, in a language without function symbols. 

Specifically, given a (structured) array of formulas, it finds justifications for these formulas, if there are any.

Rendered deductions are printed as HTML and LaTeX.

Please see help for more information.
